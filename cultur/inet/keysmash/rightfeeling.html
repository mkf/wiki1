                  <p>*raises hand* Hi. So - the use of a keysmash is emotive. You use it to indicate that you’re so overwhelmed with emotion that you can’t even type, you’re just flailing at the keyboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>So why is there a difference between a “hkelsxpxa” and a “jkfsdkas” or an “asdfs”?</p>
                  <p>Because language evolves! It’s actually really exciting to think about, but there’s a reason why slang is continually changing and why Old People are usually characterized by not knowing the slang variants that are being used by The
                    Youth - it’s because the way we use words changes over time, especially in response to technological or environmental changes.</p>
                  <p>And text-based communication - texting someone on your phone, or chatting with friends on Skype or Discord - is actually really new, this is something which started <i>in my lifetime</i>. And grammatical rules have been evolving and
                    settling into place around that form of communication.</p>
                  <p>For instance, linguistic researchers have noticed that anyone who’s grown up with texting being a normal thing will usually not end their texts or IMs with a period <i>unless</i> they’re angry or annoyed. This is because it’s a lot harder
                    to do a run-on sentence in those mediums; you can just hit ‘enter’ and go to a new line. A period, then, becomes an indicator of emphasis, instead of an indicator of “there is nothing missing from this sentence” - and it’s an indicator
                    of <i>negative</i> emphasis (rather than the positive emphasis that an exclaimation mark can give).</p>
                  <p>So, the keysmash has its own grammatical rule. And it’s one that makes sense, considering that it’s entirely possible for a keysmash to be caused <i>accidentally</i> - by something falling onto the keyboard, or a cat walking across it.
                    The rule, then, is that a deliberate keysmash and an accidental one need to be distinguishable.</p>
                  <p>So a deliberate keysmash will nearly always use keys only in the home row, and usually in a particular order that isn’t likely to have happened purely accidentally.</p>
                  <p>So, future anthropologists will likely explain it as a marker of language evolving to work with a text-based medium where expressions and body language are difficult-to-impossible to convey. Much like emojis, crytyping, and whether or
                    not you put punctuation at the end of a sentence (and in what context you do so), keysmashing is used to convey <i>how</i> you feel - in a way that body language and facial expressions would usually be expected to fill in the gap.</p>
