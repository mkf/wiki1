    </blockquote>
    <p>For a reason that maybe the original may need to explain, we
      process the input sorted and such will be exhibited in below
      examples. The original has its implementations start with a call
      to a sorting subroutine.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Examples:<br>
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}, <var>k</var> = 3</dt>
      <dd>3 elements: {1, 4, 8}, <br>
        Resulting in a minimum distance of 3</dd>
      <dt>{1, 2, 5, 7, 11, 12}, <var>k</var> = 3</dt>
      <dd>3 elements: {1, 7, 12}, <br>
        resulting in a minimum distance of 5 (between 7 and 12)</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>isFeasible</h3>
    <p>Consider the isFeasible function from the GeeksForGeeks' Radhav
      Jajodia's original. It is not too clear immediately to most and
      requires a different approach to explaining it than the original.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It accepts arguments: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the desired minimum distance called "<var>mid</var>", </li>
      <li>the desired number of elements "<var>k</var>", </li>
      <li>and the array (with its length).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Going through the sorted numbers from start to end, it counts
      (starting with the first one) the ones that are at least <var>mid</var>
      distance away from the previously counted one. When the count
      reaches <var>k</var>, it returns true. If it never does, it
      returns false.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Going through the sorted numbers from start to end, it counts
      them omitting the ones that were within &lt;<var>mid</var>
      distance from the previously counted one (less than <var>mid</var>
      <sub>units away</sub> from it). When the count reaches <var>k</var>,
      it returns true. If it never does, it returns false.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>The binary search</h3>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The function is utilized by the main algorithm in the following
      manner: a binary search over possible minimum distances is
      performed, with the boundaries being: 1 (lower boundary) and the
      upper boundary being… the value of the greatest number.<br>
    </p>
    <p>I believe that is incorrect as suboptimal and the correct upper
      boundary should be at most the distance (i.e. difference) before
      the least and the greatest element. We could also further narrow
      that down to maybe that distance divided by <var>k</var>, for an
      arithmetic average.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The original is explaining why is the lower boundary one:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>left is initialized with 1 and not with arr[0] because,
          minimum distance between each element can be one and not
          arr[0]. consider this example:</em><em><br>
        </em><em> arr[] = {9,12} and you have to place 2 element then
          left = arr[0] will force the function to look the answer
          between range arr[0] to arr[n-1], i.e 9 to 12, but the answer
          is 3 so It is required that you initialize the left with 1.</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Each check of the binary search is made at the integer
      arithmetic average (assigned to <var>mid</var>) of the current
      set lower and upper boundaries (i.e. integer division-by-two of
      the sum of them two, which means <u><em>floor</em></u>ed <sup>in
        case of positive numbers</sup>), starting with the
      aforementioned initial ones. A check is a call to isFeasible — <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>if it returns true, the lower boundary is raised to <var>mid+1</var>,
        i.e. to the plus one of the integer arithmetic average of the
        former boundaries, resulting with the next <var>mid</var>
        average being greater<br>
      </li>
      <li>if it returns false, the upper boundary is lowered to <var>mid</var>,
        i.e. to the integer arithmetic average of the former boundaries,
        resulting with the next <var>mid</var> average being lesser</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The checks stop when the boundaries will become equal or nonsense
      (lower greater than the upper), and the last <var>mid</var> that
      isFeasible returned true for is returned.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Indulging in clarifying the final loop iteration of the binary
      search<br>
    </h4>
    <p>Let's consider the check previous to the end condition being
      reached. In case of {1 2 3 4}, we get the average 2 and we can get
      either a 2+1=3 and a {3 4}, or a 2 and a {1 2}. With {1 2 3 4 5},
      we get 3 and thus either 3+1=4 and {4 5} or 3 and {1 2 3}. From
      our acquaintance with the properties of arithmetic average we know
      that these ranges can be transposed by any positive offset for
      these findings of ours to hold true. It becomes apparent that it
      must be either {1 2 3} or {1 2}.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>With {1 2 3} we get 2 and thus either 2+1=3 and [3,3], or 2
        and {1 2}.<br>
      </li>
      <li>With {1 2} we get 1 and thus either 1+1=2 and [2,2], or 1 and
        [1,1].</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We thus found that the boundaries, if we didn't err, never become
      nonsense, and the loop end condition could be (albeit less safely
      for the case we now erred) considered to be equality.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>A declarative approach to isFeasible</h3>
    <p>Let's have a function that returns an array of all the distances
      between elements, in order.<br>
    </p>
    <table cellpadding="2" width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
            <pre>(defun just-distances (arr)
  (if (null (cdr arr)) nil
      (cons (- (cadr arr) (car arr))
            (just-distances (cdr arr)))))
</pre>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">
            <pre>CL-USER&gt; (just-distances '(1 2 5 7 11 12))<br>(1 3 2 4 1)<br>CL-USER&gt; (just-distances '(1 2 4 8 9))<br>(1 2 4 1)<br></pre>

    <p>We want to look at the distances that are at least <var>mid</var>.
      Going over the not-far-enough can be otherwise interpreted as
      summing distances. Let's write a function that will sum the
      adjoining distances.<br>

    <p>The distances could be replaced with a data structure <code>(distance


        . (left . right))</code> along with a summing function to
      replace <code>+</code> : <code>(cons (+ (car <var>a</var>) (car
        <var>b</var>)) (cons (cadr <var>a</var>) (cddr <var>b</var>)))</code>.
      But that's more useful for maybe debugging, as it makes the code a
      bit more bloated and for practical purposes the elements can be
      recovered by taking the leftmost element and adding the distances
      to it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The equivalent of the function isFeasible would be taking the
      result of <var>remove-too-close</var> and see if its length is
      greater or equal to <var>k-1</var>.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>The need for lazy sequences: to get rid of checking and summing
      beyond <var>k</var> elements</h4>
    <p>What the above code needlessly does is calculating the distances
      and summing them beyond when k elements got already found. This is
      because we used eagerly evaluated lists of Common Lisp. We need to
      introduce laziness. While Common Lisp seems to have more recent
      standards introducing language constructs for lazy sequences, the
      most plain usual way to achieve laziness in sequences in Common
      Lisp has been having zero-argument lambdas as <abbr title="CDR is
        the latter part of a dotted pair which constitutes a Lisp list.
        You may recognize the concept of &quot;tail&quot;,
        &quot;rest&quot;. Dotted pairs allow for linked lists and other
        pair-based structures.">CDR</abbr>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>So instead of <code>(first . rest)</code> it is now going to be
      <code>(first . (lambda () rest))</code>.<br>
