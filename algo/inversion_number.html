<p>Task: counting inversions - calculating inversion number of a permutation of first <var>n</var> natural numbers —
 in <var>n</var><tt>log</tt><var>n</var>.</p>

<style>
  div.dent {
      margin-left: 0.2em;
      padding-left: 1.5em;
      border-left: 1px solid gray;
      margin-top: 0.1em;
  }
</style>

<p>The most usual approach is to base on <em>merge sort</em>. Not being a fan of this approach, i tried hard to avoid it.</p>

<p>The below is loosely derived/inspired from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47845960/4240261"><var>PM2 Ring</var>'s answer</a>
from the code with the signature</p>

<p>or more precisely, from <a href="https://github.com/mkf/asdspark/tree/master/asdinve/src">the code i wrote firstly in Ada2012</a>,
  that was loosely derived/inspired from it.<br>
  Note: if you want to see that code, you might want to try going back in time in commit history because
  from some point i was mostly just adapting it to what SPARK2014's prover can do,
  and that mangled it terribly.</p>

<div>
  <var>&sigma;</var>[1..<var>n</var>]<br>
  <var>tree</var>[1..<var>n</var>]<br>
  <var>count_beyond</var>[1..<var>n</var>]<br>
  <strong>function</strong> inserting(root, new) <div class="dent">
    <var>t</var> := 0<br>
    <strong>if</strong> <var>&sigma;</var>[<var>new</var>] &lt; <var>&sigma;</var>[<var>root</var>] <strong>then</strong> <div class="dent">
      <var>t</var> := 1 + <var>count_beyond</var>[<var>root</var>]<br>
      <var>branch_side</var> := Left
    </div>
    <strong>else</strong> <div class="dent">
      increment <var>count_beyond</var>[<var>root</var>]<br>
      <var>branch_side</var> := Right
    </div>
    <strong>if</strong> <var>tree</var>[<var>root</var>].children[<var>branch_side</var>] &ne; NIL <div class="dent">
      <var>t</var> := <var>t</var> + inserting(<var>tree</var>[<var>root</var>].children[<var>branch_side</var>], <var>new</var>)
    </div> <strong>else</strong> <div class="dent">
      <var>tree</var>[<var>root</var>].children[<var>branch_side</var>] := <var>new</var>
    </div>
    <strong>return</strong> <var>t</var>
  </div>
  <strong>function</strong> result <div class="dent">
    <strong>var</strong> <var>acc</var> := 0<br>
    <strong>for</strong> <var>i</var> := 1 <strong>to</strong> <var>n</var> <strong>loop</strong> <div class="dent">
      <var>acc</var> := <var>acc</var> + inserting(1, <var>i</var>)
    </div>
    <strong>return</strong> <var>acc</var>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I later were trying to develop a different approach that would make use of having the set be
  <strong>first <var>n</var></strong> natural numbers (the above does not, at all):
  I thought about taking <var>&sigma;</var><sup>-1</sup>,
  since it would be suitable for a lookup table because of that,
  then with the help of it finding, for elements from largest to smallest or vice versa,
  how many smaller elements (or greater, respectively)
  (which would be the ones left for processing) were there to the right (or to the left, respectively) of the permutation.
  I discovered this approach seemed to produce correct results when done by hand, but seems easy to implement.

<div style="margin: 2em 0;">
<p>In <samp>2 5 4 6 3 1</samp> there are 9 inversions.</p>
<div>
<p><samp>2 5 4 6 3 1</samp> — 2 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
<p><samp>2 5 4 _ 3 1</samp> — 3 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
<p><samp>2 _ 4 _ 3 1</samp> — 2 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
<p><samp>2 _ _ _ 3 1</samp> — 1 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
<p><samp>2 _ _ _ _ 1</samp> — 1 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
</div></div>

<div style="margin: 2em 0;">
  <p>In <samp>3 1 2 4 6 5</samp> there are 3 inversions.</p><div>
    <p><samp>3 1 2 4 6 5</samp> — 1 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
    <p><samp>3 1 2 4 _ 5</samp> — 0 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
    <p><samp>3 1 2 4 _ _</samp> — 0 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
    <p><samp>3 1 2 _ _ _</samp> — 2 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
    <p><samp>_ 1 2 _ _ _</samp> — 0 smaller on the right side of largest</p>
</div></div>

<p>There comes the question — is that <q><var>n<tt>log</tt><var>n</var></q> like the task asked?
    What is supposed to be the dominating operation though?
    Classic approach to this problem is <em>merge sort</em>, and other approaches
  (like the <em><q>binary counting tree</q></em>) do not rely on it being <strong>first <var>n</var></strong> natural numbers,
  and they use comparisons for sorting and it is considering the dominating operation.
  But we don't need to do any comparisons between the elements of permutation here —
  but with them being the same first <var>n</var> natural numbers, does that change anything if we were to
  do comparisons on the indices? The question is, could we do without any number comparisons.
  And if we couldn't, would it be facilitated to employ some more advanced algorithms to optimize them.
</p>

<p>Because, how do we get the information how many smaller (i.e. yet to be processed)
  are there on the right of our element? When we process the larger, we need a way to store the information about their positions.
  We could do a na&iuml;ve boolean lookup table — but maybe something like a heap-like representation of a tree,
  or simply a two-way list, would be better? Maybe build an order statistic tree? Or maybe a variation of Fenwick Binary Indexed Tree?</p>
