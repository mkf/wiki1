    <h1>on Graphviz</h1>
    <p>I'm not too good in graphviz, but the way I can do is starting
      out my drawings with <tt>dotty</tt>.</p>
    <p>The dotty user guide can be found at <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dottyguide.pdf">https://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dottyguide.pdf</a>.
      See chapter 2.1 of it, that's pretty much all that i've been
      reading of it so far.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Switch layout engines between the likes by "set graph attr" in
      dotty and "layout=dot" or "layout=neato" or "layout=circo" or
      "layout=fdp" etc. See "man 7 graphviz" for the list, and for the
      layout-specific parameters.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For basic layouts, you will only need to:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>create nodes by left click</li>
      <li>press <samp>a</samp> over node to set its attribute</li>
      <ul>
        <li>type in <samp>label=this is my node\nAnd it's multiline!</samp></li>
      </ul>
      <li>press <samp>d</samp> over node or the circle of an edge to
        delete</li>
      <li>press <samp>u</samp> to <em>undo</em><br>
      </li>
      <li>press <samp>l</samp> to relayout</li>
      <li>right click on empty graph space for main menu</li>
      <ul>
        <li>choose "save graph as" to save your graph<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>right click on node/edge for its context menu<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not sure how to run dotty in a way such so as to the graph
      having an associated <code><samp>.dot</samp></code> file, but
      probably placing it as the argument to dotty command. If it
      doesn't have it associated, "save graph as" nor "load graph" won't
      create the association seemingly, and thus the "save graph"
      (without the "as") nor "reload graph" right-click-menu commands
      will do seemingly nothing.<br>
