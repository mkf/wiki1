<h1>on Unix C bindings</h1>

<p>Well, not exactly Unix. This is one of those sites the permalink's of which
i might not care much. If you see this in webarchive, or if it is just cached in
  your browser or your brain, please note that this is probably still available under some other path.
</p>

<h2 id="signals">on signals</h2>
<p>with <code>signal</code> function you can assign a handler function (or a constant saying that you
  want to ignore or restore default behavior) to a signal. That function can do stuff like, sending that signal
  to another process with <code>kill</code> instead and leaving the receiving process intact.
</p>
<p>the <code>kill</code> function returns 0 on success, 1 on failure, and 64 if
  you asked it to do a group of processes and for some it succeeded but for some
  it did not.
</p>
<p>the function <code>strsignal</code> returns strings such as <q><em>Interrupt</em></q> for 2 (<code>SIGINT</code>).
  I have not found a way to obtain the <q><samp>SIGINT</samp></q> string, but that's probably not hard.
  Email me if this here is still up and it says i have not found a way and you did, if you want to bother with being helpful.

<h2 id="users">users</h2>
<p>get effective user ID of the user who owns the process of the program with <code>geteuid</code> function</p>
<p>get the <code>struct passwd *</code> for a user ID by using <code>getpwuid</code> function.</p>
<p>from <code>struct passwd *</code> you can get <code>-&gt;pw_name</code> (username), <code>-&gt;pw_dir</code> (home directory path)</p>
<p>you can also get <code>struct passwd *</code> by username by using <code>getpwnam</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="cwd">getting current working directory</h2>
<p>you can get your current working directory using the function <code>getcwd</code>.</p>
<p>don't use the deprecated <code>getwd</code>, which does not allow to specify the size of your buffer,
  and can cause error of writing beyond the end of your allocated buffer</p>
<p>there is also a GNU-specific <code>get_current_dir_name</code> function, which will allocate the string for you,
  note that you will have to <code>free</code> it.</p>
<h2 id="chdir">changing the current directory (cd)</h2>
<p>one neat trick is to just arithmetically negate the return value of <code>chdir</code> since
  it can return only 0 or -1 anyway. Note: really, look at what the error was, see the <code>errno</code></p>
<h2 id="errno">on <code>errno</code></h2>
<p><em>errno</em> is a global variable that stores the error of last thing that failed that uses it.
  in <code>&lt;errno.h&gt;</code> you can find not only them by their names, but also
  functions like <code>strerror</code> which will give you a neat description string for an errno.</p>
<h2 id="fork"><code>fork</code></h2>
<p>the function <code>fork</code> forks your program (process) into two processes. To one it
  returns zero (the new one, the child), and to the other (the parent, the original one) it returns the new process ID of the child.
  If there was an error, it returns <samp>-1</samp>, and you can see the error in <tt>errno</tt>.</p>
<h2 id="waitpid"><code>waitpid</code></h2>
<p>the function <code>waitpid</code> will make your program process wait until the process that you called it about
  will terminate. or, if you ask it to, also if it will stop. and if you ask, also if it gets continued.
  default is just about termination. look up its manual for info about a bunch of macros
  that will tell you what does the status value that <code>waitpid</code> wrote for you really means,
  like <code>WIFEXITED</code> whether it exited normally, <code>WEXITSTATUS</code> with what exit code;
  <code>WIFSIGNALED</code> whether by unhandled signal, <code>WTERMSIG</code> from what signal.
</p>
<h2 id="exec"><code>exec*</code></h2>
<p>the <code>exec*</code> functions <q>replace the current process image with new process image</q>, like from an executable file.</p>
<p>the function <code>execvp</code> and <code>execv</code> take just the filename and the arguments list.</p>
<p>the ones ending with «<tt>e</tt>» also take a table of <code>KEY=value</code> environment variable entries. but they are inherited besides that.</p>
<p>the ones with «<tt>p</tt>» differ from the ones without in that they will also, for relative filepaths,
  look in all the directories specified in the <code><var>PATH</var></code> variable.</p>
