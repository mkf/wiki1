    <h1 id="blackberry-q20-classic">Blackberry Q20 Classic</h1>
    <p><em>using a Blackberry Classic / Q20 as primary phone for a year
        2022/23</em></p>
    <p><em>(besides a smartphone, and also mostly besides a Palm)<br>
      </em></p>
    <h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
    <h3 id="deterioration">Deterioration</h3>
    <p>I bought it with a battery far from perfect, but it seemed to
      deteriorate a lot over this less than a year. Precisely 24h of
      uptime is
      non-usable for a non-smartphone.</p>
    <h3
      id="it-behaves-quite-odd-when-it-tries-to-charge-itself-from-zero">It
behaves
      quite odd when it tries to charge itself from zero</h3>
    <p>It has a peculiar technique of finding a good moment to try
      powering
      up to react to user’s button press prompting for that, but still
      doesn’t
      do so on its own usually.</p>
    <p>There is a sophisticated color coding going on about what color
      does
      the LED blink before the phone turns on from zero power.</p>
    <h3 id="system-stats-of-apps">System stats of apps</h3>
    <p>Battery life can be inspected with a stats manager for time
      periods
      that don’t reset just on last full charge - up to 48h.</p>
    <p>The battery stats analyzer doesn’t account for app-induced
      wake-ups
      enough however. That makes especially some Android-compat layer
      apps
      turn into battery hogs just staying in background to receive
      notifications.</p>
    <p>But there is analysis of CPU and RAM and network consumption each
      app, along with overall CPU use statistics, also for up to 48h.</p>
    <h2 id="blackberry-id-issues">Blackberry ID issues</h2>
    <p>The servers are down. And they were never meant to be. Some
      services
      like I guess BBM still try to get your Blackberry ID. And
      sometimes on a
      factory reset it will just assume it didn’t get a network
      connection and
      you’re gonna be stuck on a WiFi choice screen, having to use
      quirky ways
      like a screen reader to make your way out to skip it, or just
      going into
      Recent apps. A lot of devices are permanently locked with a
      Blackberry
      account.</p>
    <p>And you are going to get notifications a lot.</p>
    <h2 id="blackberry-hub">Blackberry Hub</h2>
    <p>You swipe to it from the homescreen. It’s to the left of recent
      apps,
      to the right of recent apps are the app icons.</p>
    <h3 id="app-notifications">App notifications</h3>
    <p>Just turn them off, move them out of your Hub. You want neither
      the
      frequent notifications about not having Blackberry ID set up nor
      you
      want the Android apps to show you anything because you will see no
      content until you tap it - in order to see a late-Holo Jelly Bean
      themed
      notification taken straight out of a vanilla Android 4.3 device.</p>
    <h3 id="smsmms-texts">SMS/MMS texts</h3>
    <p>They stay in your Hub until you delete them. There is a feature
      to
      export a message into another app via Sharing. What also stays in
      your
      Hub is the calls. Unless you opt to not have them shown in the Hub
      listing.</p>
    <h3 id="email">Email</h3>
    <p>The real reason for Blackberry Hub.</p>
    <p>Unread messages in picked synchronized folders appear directly in
      Hub, with an icon that they are not from an inbox. Although
      picking
      folders to synchronize is a chore, can’t just pick all subfolders.
      There
      is a view to list all attachments in Hub. And the Docs To Go app
      that
      you will find preinstalled can work doc docx and xsl xslx just
      great.</p>
    <p>Flagged emails automatically go to a folder for them in Remember.
      When you move emails, it remembers where.</p>
    <p>But: doesn’t have inline replying. Only the business style with
      quote
      below after a header.</p>
    <h2 id="the-remember-app">The Remember app</h2>
    <p>There’s folders for notes, folders for tasks, as well as tags for
      either.</p>
    <p>Elements have a title and a description field with optional
      formatting (font size two sizes down from Normal and many sizes
      up, 16
      font colors, checkboxes inline, bullet and numbered lists, B/I/U
      of
      course) and tags, as well as attachments and voice notes. Tasks
      can have
      both a reminder set as well as a separate due date</p>
    <h2 id="calendar-and-contacts">Calendar and contacts</h2>
    <p>CardDAV and CalDAV enable you to sync with Fastmail or Nextcloud
      or
      whatever. Pretty neat. Calendar has alarms in it. The app is done
      well.</p>
    <h2 id="music-multimedia">Music &amp; multimedia</h2>
    <p>A very apparent and controllable aptX Bluetooth codec support.</p>
    <p>Ability to listen to music on the phone’s earpiece instead of the
      loudspeaker.</p>
    <p>Not showing up on lock screen, but at least the middle volume
      button
      works for it. Only thing that button does, because it doesn’t have
      the
      functions known from original Blackberries despite being confused
      to be
      the same.</p>
    <p>MHL HDMI and Miracast support are to let you present a document
      in a
      business setting. Or a movie maybe. Haven’t tried.</p>
    <p>Camera has Time Shift mode for portraits, quite neat.</p>
    <h2 id="other-hard-features">Other hard features</h2>
    <p>Seemingly quite first class Wi-Fi Direct support.</p>
    <p>Flashlight sometimes turns off suddenly while appearing still on
      in
      the system.</p>
    <p>LTE - 4G, with the “Active Point” feature being quite smart about
      when it switches off, also telling you about devices connected.</p>
    <p>Screenshots can be made very quickly with Volume Up + Down,
      almost
      immediately and not too interruptively.</p>
    <p>VPN kinds supported, with many parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CheckPoint Software
        Technologies VPN-1 <br>
      </li>
      <li>Koncentrator Cisco VPN 3000 <br>
      </li>
      <li>Cisco Secure PIX
        Firewall VPN <br>
      </li>
      <li>Cisco IOS with Easy VPN Server <br>
      </li>
      <li>Cisco ASA</li>
      <li> Cisco
        AnyConnect <br>
      </li>
      <li>Juniper IPsec VPN (series SRX, series NetScreen, series
        MAG/SA) <br>
      </li>
      <li>Microsoft IKEv2 VPN Server <br>
      </li>
      <li>Generic IKEv2 VPN Server</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The keyboard has a $ key. It’s funny, it’s just that.</p>
    <p>The keyboard is much better than that on Blackberry Q5. I had one
      in
      hands for a few days.</p>
    <p>The lock screen has a notifications view, and one of the lock
      methods
      is having you swipe one of a grid of random digits into a position
      on a
      photo, not sure if custom or only supplied.</p>
    <p>I can’t figure out quick silent mode without unlocking or time
      preset
      without creating calendar events. I used to think the middle key
      was
      supposed to do that.</p>
    <h2 id="the-smart-tags-app">The smart tags app</h2>
    <p>The tags app with NFC and 2D/1D barcode scan and generation (to
      file
      as well). A writable NFC tag can trigger a lot in the system.</p>
    <h2 id="other-stuff-impaired-by-dead-blackberry-servers">Other stuff
      impaired by dead Blackberry servers</h2>
    <p>All kinds of maps and stuff. The Assistant, brought up with
      dollar or
      zero key from homescreen, doesn’t do voice recognition. Not sure
      if
      there is a very basic offline one but I think not.</p>
    <h2 id="the-home-screen">The home screen</h2>
    <p>Pressing the End Call button takes you to a Recent Apps view
      where
      you can see what’s running in background/cache. The tiles serve as
      kind
      of widgets because there is often a special view of what’s open in
      them
      if the app supports it.</p>
    <p>You can have home screen keyboard key shortcuts for starting an
      app,
      typing an email or a text to a specified recipient, speed dial of
      course, as well as creating a new note or a task in Remember, or
      to
      toggle ringer modes or to lock the device. Zero and $ take you
      straight
      to typing into the Assistant.</p>
    <p>You can have folders for the apps, and all apps need to be on the
      home screens.</p>
    <p>There is a red clock bedtime mode, that you can access straight
      from
      the lock screen, with alarms indicated on the face but it actually
      also
      doesn’t stay on even on charger.</p>
    <h2 id="the-spell-checker-and-autocorrect">The spell checker and
      autocorrect</h2>
    <p>You don’t capitalize “i” whilst English? you will need to alias
      “I”
      to “i”, only let yourself type in “I” as “Ii” with another alias
      (“shortcut”).</p>
    <p>At least Polish language has all the feminine forms of first
      person
      active verbs just missing entirely, you need to add each by hand
      to your
      dictionary.</p>
    <h2 id="the-web-browsing-tls">The web browsing &amp; TLS</h2>
    <p>The built-in browser is quite sluggish. But you can have Opera
      Mini.</p>
    <p>I’m not sure if TLS 1.3 works on the device but TLS 1.2 sure
      does.
      But you need to browse through root CA certs to download and
      install to
      get things to work, and I failed to find them all.</p>
    <h2 id="apps.-android-apps-because-there-is-no-other.">Apps. Android
      apps, because there is no other.</h2>
    <p>You can’t have any first-class citizen apps these days, they’re
      not
      available.</p>
    <p>The emulation layer often feels botched. Is amazing, but still.</p>
    <p>Android apps notifications - you will see no content until you
      tap
      it: in order to see a late-Holo Jelly Bean themed notification
      taken
      straight out of a vanilla Android 4.3 device.</p>
    <p>If you set something to be a default app, there is no way to
      reach
      the settings about it to fix it - you can’t access the Android app
      settings as Android app settings even though they pretty sure must
      be
      somewhere there.</p>
    <p>Messenger apps like Telegram FOSS are utterlly sluggish to the
      point
      of being unusable. In an Android app, two fingers from the top
      lets you
      choose whether to resize app screen to higher density or into a
      more
      vertical rectangle.</p>
    <p>F-Droid apps matching API 16 sometimes ran but sometimes failed
      to
      install.</p>
    <p>It is the most recent OS version that supports user-supplied
      apks.
      Earlier required you to repackage them or to just use the Amazon
      App
      Store that also came app rather late.</p>
    <p>I did manage to run B4A’s both Designer and regular device app
      quite
      well.</p>
    <p>BTW, keyboard is just keycodes, that simply works.</p>
    <p>ConnectBot was pretty cool and ran excellent. (pressing the
      trackpad
      =Ctrl)</p>
    <p>Opening the keyboard’s SYM view makes apps like ConnectBot resize
      for
      a moment after a split second. Into a very thin view.</p>
    <p>ES File Explorer from Amazon App Store was almost usable, and it
      was
      my access to WebDAV file store.</p>
