    <h1 id="blackberry-q20-classic" align="justify">Blackberry Q20
      Classic</h1>
    <p align="justify"><em>using a Blackberry Classic / Q20 as primary
        phone for a year 2022/23</em></p>
    <p align="justify"><em>(besides a smartphone, and also mostly
        besides a Palm)<br>
      </em></p>
    <h2 id="battery-life" align="justify">Battery life</h2>
    <h3 id="deterioration" align="justify">Deterioration</h3>
    <p align="justify">I bought it with a battery far from perfect, but
      it seemed to deteriorate a lot over this less than a year.
      Precisely 24h of uptime is non-usable for a non-smartphone.</p>
    <h3
      id="it-behaves-quite-odd-when-it-tries-to-charge-itself-from-zero"
      align="justify">It behaves quite odd when it tries to charge
      itself from zero</h3>
    <p align="justify">It has a peculiar technique of finding a good
      moment to try powering up to react to user’s button press
      prompting for that, but still doesn’t do so on its own usually.</p>
    <p align="justify">There is a sophisticated color coding going on
      about what color does the LED blink before the phone turns on from
      zero power.</p>
    <h3 id="system-stats-of-apps" align="justify">System stats of apps</h3>
    <p align="justify">Battery life can be inspected with a stats
      manager for time periods that don’t reset just on last full charge
      - up to 48h.</p>
    <p align="justify">The battery stats analyzer doesn’t account for
      app-induced wake-ups enough however. That makes especially some
      Android-compat layer apps turn into battery hogs just staying in
      background to receive notifications.</p>
    <p align="justify">But there is analysis of CPU and RAM and network
      consumption each app, along with overall CPU use statistics, also
      for up to 48h.</p>
    <h2 id="blackberry-id-issues" align="justify">Blackberry ID issues</h2>
    <p align="justify">The servers are down. And they were never meant
      to be. Some services like I guess BBM still try to get your
      Blackberry ID. And sometimes on a factory reset it will just
      assume it didn’t get a network connection and you’re gonna be
      stuck on a WiFi choice screen, having to use quirky ways like a
      screen reader to make your way out to skip it, or just going into
      Recent apps. A lot of devices are permanently locked with a
      Blackberry account.</p>
    <p align="justify">And you are going to get notifications a lot.</p>
    <h2 id="blackberry-hub" align="justify">Blackberry Hub</h2>
    <p align="justify">You swipe to it from the homescreen. It’s to the
      left of recent apps, to the right of recent apps are the app
      icons.</p>
    <h3 id="app-notifications" align="justify">App notifications</h3>
    <p align="justify">Just turn them off, move them out of your Hub.
      You want neither the frequent notifications about not having
      Blackberry ID set up nor you want the Android apps to show you
      anything because you will see no content until you tap it - in
      order to see a late-Holo Jelly Bean themed notification taken
      straight out of a vanilla Android 4.3 device.</p>
    <h3 id="smsmms-texts" align="justify">SMS/MMS texts</h3>
    <p align="justify">They stay in your Hub until you delete them.
      There is a feature to export a message into another app via
      Sharing. What also stays in your Hub is the calls. Unless you opt
      to not have them shown in the Hub listing.</p>
    <h3 id="email" align="justify">Email</h3>
    <p align="justify">The real reason for Blackberry Hub.</p>
    <p align="justify">Unread messages in picked synchronized folders
      appear directly in Hub, with an icon that they are not from an
      inbox. Although picking folders to synchronize is a chore, can’t
      just pick all subfolders. There is a view to list all attachments
      in Hub. And the Docs To Go app that you will find preinstalled can
      work doc docx and xsl xslx just great.</p>
    <p align="justify">Flagged emails automatically go to a folder for
      them in Remember.</p>
    <p align="justify">When you move emails between IMAP folders, it
      remembers where to.</p>
    <p align="justify">But: doesn’t have inline replying. Only the
      business style with quote below after a header.</p>
    <h2 id="the-remember-app" align="justify">The Remember app</h2>
    <p align="justify">There’s folders for notes, folders for tasks, as
      well as tags for either.</p>
    <p align="justify">Elements have a title and a description field
      with optional formatting (font size two sizes down from Normal and
      many sizes up, 16 font colors, checkboxes inline, bullet and
      numbered lists, B/I/U of course) and tags, as well as attachments
      and voice notes. Tasks can have both a reminder set as well as a
      separate due date</p>
    <h2 id="calendar-and-contacts" align="justify">Calendar and contacts</h2>
    <p align="justify">CardDAV and CalDAV enable you to sync with
      Fastmail or Nextcloud or whatever. Pretty neat. Calendar has
      alarms in it. The app is done well.</p>
    <h2 id="music-multimedia" align="justify">Music &amp; multimedia</h2>
    <p align="justify">A very apparent and controllable aptX Bluetooth
      codec support.</p>
    <p align="justify">Ability to listen to music on the phone’s
      earpiece instead of the loudspeaker.</p>
    <p align="justify">Not showing up on lock screen, but at least the
      middle volume button works for it. Only thing that button does,
      because it doesn’t have the functions known from original
      Blackberries despite being confused to be the same.</p>
    <p align="justify">MHL HDMI and Miracast support are to let you
      present a document in a business setting. Or a movie maybe.
      Haven’t tried.</p>
    <p align="justify">Camera has Time Shift mode for portraits, quite
      neat.</p>
    <h2 id="other-hard-features" align="justify">Other hard features</h2>
    <p align="justify">Seemingly quite first class Wi-Fi Direct support.</p>
    <p align="justify">Flashlight sometimes turns off suddenly while
      appearing still on in the system.</p>
    <p align="justify">LTE - 4G, with the “Active Point” feature being
      quite smart about when it switches off, also telling you about
      devices connected.</p>
    <p align="justify">Screenshots can be made very quickly with Volume
      Up + Down, almost immediately and not too interruptively.</p>
    <p align="justify">VPN kinds supported, with many parameters:</p>
    <div align="justify">
      <ul>
        <li>CheckPoint Software Technologies VPN-1 <br>
        </li>
        <li>Koncentrator Cisco VPN 3000 <br>
        </li>
        <li>Cisco Secure PIX Firewall VPN <br>
        </li>
        <li>Cisco IOS with Easy VPN Server <br>
        </li>
        <li>Cisco ASA</li>
        <li> Cisco AnyConnect <br>
        </li>
        <li>Juniper IPsec VPN (series SRX, series NetScreen, series
          MAG/SA) <br>
        </li>
        <li>Microsoft IKEv2 VPN Server <br>
        </li>
        <li>Generic IKEv2 VPN Server</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p align="justify">The keyboard has a $ key. It’s funny, it’s just
      that.</p>
    <p align="justify">The keyboard is much better than that on
      Blackberry Q5. I had one in hands for a few days.</p>
    <p align="justify">The lock screen has a notifications view, and one
      of the lock methods is having you swipe one of a grid of random
      digits into a position on a photo, not sure if custom or only
      supplied.</p>
    <p align="justify">I can’t figure out quick silent mode without
      unlocking or time preset without creating calendar events. I used
      to think the middle key was supposed to do that.</p>
    <h2 id="the-smart-tags-app" align="justify">The smart tags app</h2>
    <p align="justify">The tags app with NFC and 2D/1D barcode scan and
      generation (to file as well). A writable NFC tag can trigger a lot
      in the system.</p>
    <h2 id="other-stuff-impaired-by-dead-blackberry-servers"
      align="justify">Other stuff impaired by dead Blackberry servers</h2>
    <p align="justify">All kinds of maps and stuff. The Assistant,
      brought up with dollar or zero key from homescreen, doesn’t do
      voice recognition. Not sure if there is a very basic offline one
      but I think not.</p>
    <h2 id="the-home-screen" align="justify">The home screen</h2>
    <p align="justify">Pressing the End Call button takes you to a
      Recent Apps view where you can see what’s running in
      background/cache. The tiles serve as kind of widgets because there
      is often a special view of what’s open in them if the app supports
      it.</p>
    <p align="justify">You can have home screen keyboard key shortcuts
      for starting an app, typing an email or a text to a specified
      recipient, speed dial of course, as well as creating a new note or
      a task in Remember, or to toggle ringer modes or to lock the
      device. Zero and $ take you straight to typing into the Assistant.</p>
    <p align="justify">You can have folders for the apps, and all apps
      need to be on the home screens.</p>
    <p align="justify">There is a red clock bedtime mode, that you can
      access straight from the lock screen, with alarms indicated on the
      face but it actually also doesn’t stay on even on charger.</p>
    <h2 id="the-spell-checker-and-autocorrect" align="justify">The spell
      checker and autocorrect</h2>
    <p align="justify">You don’t capitalize “i” whilst English? you will
      need to alias “I” to “i”, only let yourself type in “I” as “Ii”
      with another alias (“shortcut”).</p>
    <p align="justify">At least Polish language has all the feminine
      forms of first person active verbs just missing entirely, you need
      to add each by hand to your dictionary.</p>
    <h2 id="the-web-browsing-tls" align="justify">The web browsing &amp;
      TLS</h2>
    <p align="justify">The built-in browser is quite sluggish. But you
      can have Opera Mini.</p>
    <p align="justify">I’m not sure if TLS 1.3 works on the device but
      TLS 1.2 sure does. But you need to browse through root CA certs to
      download and install to get things to work, and I failed to find
      them all.</p>
    <h2 id="apps.-android-apps-because-there-is-no-other."
      align="justify">Apps. Android apps, because there is no other.</h2>
    <p align="justify">You can’t have any first-class citizen apps these
      days, they’re not available.</p>
    <p align="justify">The emulation layer often feels botched. Is
      amazing, but still.</p>
    <p align="justify">Android apps notifications - you will see no
      content until you tap it: in order to see a late-Holo Jelly Bean
      themed notification taken straight out of a vanilla Android 4.3
      device.</p>
    <p align="justify">If you set something to be a default app, there
      is no way to reach the settings about it to fix it - you can’t
      access the Android app settings as Android app settings even
      though they pretty sure must be somewhere there.</p>
    <p align="justify">Messenger apps like Telegram FOSS are utterlly
      sluggish to the point of being unusable. In an Android app, two
      fingers from the top lets you choose whether to resize app screen
      to higher density or into a more vertical rectangle.</p>
    <p align="justify">F-Droid apps matching API 16 sometimes ran but
      sometimes failed to install.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is the most recent OS version that supports
      user-supplied apks. Earlier required you to repackage them or to
      just use the Amazon App Store that also came app rather late.</p>
    <p align="justify">I did manage to run B4A’s both Designer and
      regular device app quite well.</p>
    <p align="justify">BTW, keyboard is just keycodes, that simply
      works.</p>
    <p align="justify">ConnectBot was pretty cool and ran excellent.
      (pressing the trackpad =Ctrl)</p>
    <p align="justify">Opening the keyboard’s SYM view makes apps like
      ConnectBot resize for a moment after a split second. Into a very
      thin view.</p>
    <p align="justify">ES File Explorer from Amazon App Store was almost
      usable, and it was my access to WebDAV file store.</p>
