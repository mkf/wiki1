    <p>[…]
    <p>Through this sub I found out about Forkner shorthand, and within a very short period I've fallen in love with the system. It doesn't have a steep learning curve and even with the few materials that are out there, fluency can be reached.
    <p>I found the instruction book from 1955 on Hathi Trust, but found that the scans offered there are of low resolution. Luckily I found a way to pull in a higher resolution version of each file and combined the pages to the book that can be found here:

    <p>[…] I think many people can benefit from learning Forkner, especially as an introduction to shorthand in general.
