<title>my dental healthcare â€” wiki1.mikf.pl</title>

<p>A long time ago, I got rear upper left tooth eroded badly, and my upper right canine something-like cracked in half vertically because of orthodontic issues.</p>

<p>November 17th, 2019. 10pm. I go to nightly dental healthcare, have the right upper canine opened and devitalized. Am told to register for a regular visit to my dentist the next day asap.</p>

<p>I procrastinate it.</p>

<p>February 7th, 2020. Regular appointment, scheduled by phone, the place that did nightly care chosen,
  another dentist tho (bc the lady on nightly care doesn't do preservative care).
  My rear upper left tooth is in worse condition, gets devitalized.</p>

<p>February 11th. Regular appointment, scheduled on the previous one. The canine canal is taken care of.</p>

<p>February 14th. Regular appointment, scheduled back on Feb 7th. Amputation of the nerve tissue from the rear tooth.</p>

<p>February 18th. The canine, having a temporary filling on the side that it was cracked, was subject to pressure from the tooth on its side, through the filling. That resulted in the canine cracking a little further. I suspect leakage into the canal might occur.</p>

<p>February 19th. I failed to attend a visit scheduled on February 14th. No visit is scheduled presently. I gotta make that phone call. I am worried though, as I am busy this Friday and later classes start, and full schedule is not sure yet. So idk how to handle that. I hope to discuss that with a psychologist soon.</p>
