    <tr><td><code>_foo</code><td>convention-only, PEP8<td>hint about internality of method</tr>
    <tr><td><code>foo_</code><td>convention-only, PEP8<td>avoiding a keyword/naming conflict</tr>
    <tr><td><code>__foo</code><td>name mangling (prefixing)<td>name gets rewritten by prefixing with <code>_<em>{<samp>class name</samp>}</em></code>. Idk what happens when they are import&en;renamed.</tr>
    <tr><td><code>__foo__</code><td>called/used by language<td>name might have special meaning and special use in the language, usually just in case of methods, now or in the future. Might override pre-set stuff of the language. afaik field names can also conflict with method names just as well, contrary what one professor once seemed to tell me.</tr>
