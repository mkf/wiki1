    <h2>Mc* programs</h2>
    <p>I once dug up an old "#PalmOS" tweet from an old Twitter account
      of mine, dating back to August 2012 when I was 13yrs old.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I've just found an old website with some great apps for #PalmOS
        which I used a long time ago, created by their authors. <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://is.gd/AYXVkQ">http://is.gd/AYXVkQ</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>‚Äî <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://mikemccollister.com">mikemccollister.com,


        you need to navigate to "Mike" at least these days</a></p>
    <p>And there was ScreenPrefs among the programs there, a utility
      that allowed to select the color pallette for the device to
      operate in, iirc allowing to increase it greatly! A great find!</p>
    <p>Also contains "McNits: Mike‚Äôs Palm Programming Nitpicks"</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>McNits is a series of articles that I wrote for the ‚ÄúHandheld
        Computing Developer‚Äù website. They are a compilation of nitpicks
        that I have concerning those not-so-great Palm OS programs. Some
        of these are suggestions brought forth by PalmSource, some by
        me, others are just common sense.</p>
      <p>[‚Ä¶] a series of articles to help Palm OS developers create high
        quality and consistent programs.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And also some tips on increasing productivity with the simple
      MemoPad utility.</p>
    <p>That stuff, especially the software downloads, especially
      ScreenPrefs, I need to later make sure web.archive.org/save will
      grasp well or if it won't want to then I will host at least
      ScreenPrefs on an own website just in case.</p>
    <h2>Polish diacritics</h2>
    <p>First I found <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="http://sergem.net/interpilot/">Interpilot website</a>
      which referred me to use a new piece of software "PiLoc" instead,
      for which the duckduckgo finds were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://palm.penreader.com">https://palm.penreader.com</a>
        which turned out to only link to defunct parts of Paragon
        Software website for downloads, and<br>
      </li>
      <li><a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://palmgear.penreader.com/PalmOS/PiLoc/Polish_PiLoc.html">http://palmgear.penreader.com/PalmOS/PiLoc/Polish_PiLoc.html</a>
        which linked to either defunct palmgear website mirror or to a
        piloc.penreader.com defunct cgi "Download Wizard"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have a recollection of the names of both Interpilot and PiLoc
      from my old days.</p>
    <p>The downloads for Interpilot on its website work well so
      Interpilot is what I will go with.</p>

    <h2>PalmPrint</h2>
    <p>printing appears entirely possible with PalmPrint without a
      serial number. it just appends a trailing HyperCam-esque thing to
      the end of a print.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The serial number in Codez4Palm, supposedly for 4.4.1, is denied
      any functionality in both 4.4.1 and 4.4.3 as a 3.(x?) license key,
      and that after removing the trailing "P" from it as otherwise it's
      treated as invalid.</p>
    <p>When printing in modes utilizing Palm fonts, and having some
      internationalization like Interpilot, it prints with the
      diacritics as they are on the device.</p>
    <p>Printing ToDos doesn't list whether they're done or not when you
      print all of them, and it spans them over two lines each with one
      interleaving blank line.<br>

    <h4>Infrared HotSync</h4>

    <p>the "Image Transfer" functionality of "Wireless Link" had to be
      disabled for HotSync Manager not to tell us to read a nonexistent

    <h3>BSD/Linux</h3>
    <p>J-Pilot is available in neither Nixpkgs (Nix/NixOS) nor HaikuOS's
      Depot but that wasn't that unexpected; the good news is that
      J-Pilot has reached 2.0 in 2021, with main change being GTK3. <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://jpilot.org">https://jpilot.org</a>
      I don't exactly like the 2.0 after all and often resort to the old
      stable.<br>
