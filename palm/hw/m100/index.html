    <h2>Joining the Discord server<br>
    </h2>
    <p align="justify">Yesterday I joined the PalmDB Discord server. I
      found it via the PalmDB website:<br>
      <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://palmdb.net">https://palmdb.net</a><br>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I first saw there the Community Highlights side
      pane that shows excerpts from the Discord server. It has a link to
      Discord on the bottom, but it's a channel link and not an invite
      so for someone who hasn't yet gotten an invite, it leads to an
      error. The invite can be found in the Community dropdown of the
      top navigation bar, though. Also you can join with my link (the
      admins will see that it's via me):<br>

    <h3>The off-topic (of the repair) on my other stuff<br>
    </h3>
    <p align="justify">I immediately went to the #palm-plaza channel and
      saw a friend and some people I followed on Twitter, and promptly
      put forward greetings and an introduction. The introduction
      mentioned my gemlog, and <em>nkorth</em> caught on that with
      thoughts of making Plucker support Gemini, themselves. Then I
      brought on the topic of my broken Palm Portable Keyboard (details
      in previous gemlog post). <em>Guybrush</em> responded, saying
      they had a new in box Palm Universal Keyboard with the same issue
      (and some sort of short that ran the Palm battery down very fast
      when connected), and that it's basically impossible to fix since
      it's a flexible PCB. Tavisco then advised me to buy the IrDA
      wireless ones since it seems more readily available having had
      been released later. And some words later I learned I could have
      installed Graffiti 1 on Graffiti 2 devices.<br>

    <h2>The m100 issue</h2>
    <p><img src="08_659_instr.jpg" alt="a screenshot from #palm-plaza:
        the quoted messages from Tavisco and the reference photo with a
        &quot;hands clapping&quot; emoji reaction from someone below it.
        on the bottom that's me saying i'm opening it up rn... hard to
        recognize some of the screws, some lookl like asterisks, some
        like imbus, some like plus, and im talking about the first four
        ones" moz-do-not-send="true" title="discord screenshot:
        instructional, reference photo" height="600" align="right"
        width="270">And then I mentioned having a
      never-working-since-purchase m100 that I got from my partner.</p>

        What problem it has? By any chance it its that you insert the
        batteries and nothing happens?<br>
      </p>
      <p>That's a very common issue on M100 and easily fixable<br>
      </p>
      <p>The battery terminals are pressure contacted on the mother
        board<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, you need to open it up, and stretch the contacts a little
        to make them make a better contact<br>

      <p>Bought a M100 that had this issue too, and worked like a charm
        (aside screen issues) after :P </p>

    <p>Within three minutes I had myself finding the m100 and opening it
      up.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The four screws were hard to recognize for a moment, some looked
      like astrisk, some like imbus, some like plus/philips. But they
      all ended up going perfectly under a No.5 asterisk screwdriver.<br>

      moz-do-not-send="true" height="473" align="right" width="270">
    <p>The connectors on the board turned out to be quite damaged
      (corroded or scratched too badly in their default middle touch
      position, a "bad spot" as <em>Tavisco</em> said) and the bendable
      connectors were quite flattened indeed.<a

        square that i broke off with the pliers" height="454"
        align="right" width="216">But after fiddling with the
      connectors, bending and stretching them, pulling them off (when
      loosened) and bending them to tighten them, repeatedly squashing
      the thing together and putting batteries in and reaching failure,
      at one point one broke when I got frustrated and had my moves too
      uncareful and forceful. Fortunately, dum me with help of <em>Tavisco</em>
      realized that it was actually just one redundant half of a
      connector.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In the image on the right you can see the tiny bright square that
      I broke off with the pliers.<br>
    </p>
    <p>After seven more minutes of fiddling, I exclaimed in chat: <img

    </div>
    <br>
    <p>I then squished the handheld back together, with the bent
      connectors springing it outward against me, and then screwed it
      back, with the screw next to the connectors ending up messed up
      from screwing it too far (indefinitely, which is undesired to be
      possible).<br>
