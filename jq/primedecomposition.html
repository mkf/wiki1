<p>"factors" as defined below emits a stream of all the prime factors of the input integer.
The implementation is compact, fast and highly space-efficient:
no space is required to store the primes or factors already computed,
there is no reliance on an "is_prime" function, and square roots are only computed if needed.
</p><p>The economy comes about through the use of the builtin filter recurse/1,
and the use of the state vector: [p, n, valid, sqrt],
where p is the candidate factor, n is the number still to be factored,
valid is a flag, and sqrt is either null or the square root of n.
</p><p>The caveat is that the program uses jq's builtin arithmetic operations. Since
jq currently uses IEEE 754 64-bit numbers, the following program will only be
reliable for integers up to and including 9,007,199,254,740,992 (2^53). However, "factors"
could be easily modified to work with a "BigInt" library for jq, such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://gist.github.com/pkoppstein/d06a123f30c033195841">BigInt.jq</a>.
