<h1>on HaikuOS</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href=mail.html>on the mail_daemon</a>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>when in QEMU/KVM virt-manager (an outdated installation like
from NixOS nixpkgs) faced with a choice between presets for Nightly and for r1beta1 but installing r1beta2, choosing the Nightly preset has been advised to me by imAlwaysLivid
<li>many of the services can be managed with <tt>launch_roster</tt>, see its <tt>--help</tt>
<li>another allegedly neat repo to know is
<a href="http://haikuware.ru" target="_blank">LOTE aka Haikuware.ru</a>
</ul>
<h2>building system components separately</h2>
<p>to build a system component like for example
<tt>add-ons/mail_daemon</tt> but not the whole Haiku,
use <code>jam -q mail_daemon</code>
