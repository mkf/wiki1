    <em>(! take it from the sticker image, ocr in description is wrong)</em>
    <h2> Behavior</h2>
    <p> A CD-RW recorded on a Power Mac G5 once got reported to me to
      contain a 15GB and counting of files by Windows 98.</p>
    <p>When password is not set, login screen is skipped. At least I can
      be sure my VNC would start...<br>
    </p>
    <h2> Drivers</h2>
    <h3> Dell Latitude CPx H</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>W98V69.EXE</dt>
      <dd> ATI Mobility M1 driver (last version in Dell catalogue with a
        description mentioning Windows 98)<br>
        <p>Video Drivers (ATI Rage Mobility-M1) [note: onboard video)
          version A07</p>
        <p>For Dell Portables using ATI Mobility-M1 graphics chip</p>
        <p><samp>sha256

    <dl>
      <dt> TS9UA03Z.exe</dt>
      <dd>Latitude Alps Touch Pad/Stick Drivers version A03
        <p><samp>sha256
            807eda895e0a93c437569c85b351910f8ec6ef2e233b51152950682f057d0c9f</samp>
        </p>
        <p>The issue with cursor pushing to the upper right corner fast
          unless countered with exactly full force of the track stick
          didn't go away after installing the drivers, but instead it
          started going the opposite way into the lower left corner.
          Either disable the Stick (Touch Pad only) from the driver
          settings after installing this, of disable the "PS/2 Compliant
          Mouse Port" device altogether. </p>

    <blockquote>To register the assembly, you must use the .NET
      equivalent of regsvr32, regasm. This is located in the framework
      directory, usually "<em>C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727</em>".







      To register it, open a command prompt and run the following
      command, assuming that the framework directory and the assemblies
      directory are in the environment's current path.<br>

    <h2>Programs<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The VNC client/server to probably best use on Windows 98 is the
      last supported version of TightVNC for it. It is advertised pretty
      clear on their website.<br>
